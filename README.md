# StudySync

We have developed an innovative college Android app, which is divided into two parts: one for students and an Admin app for teachers to control the overall functionality. This app comprises four main features:

1. Time Table: In this section, students can view the classes scheduled for the day with statuses such as Pending, Running, and Completed. Pending classes are highlighted in color to indicate upcoming sessions, running classes are displayed in green, and completed classes are shown in grey. Additionally, students can access a weekly timetable for all days.

2. Notes: The Notes section allows students to reference materials provided by teachers through the admin panel, facilitating ease of study and convenience.

3. Notice Board: All essential announcements and notices are centralized in this section. Teachers manage and control the information displayed on the Notice Board through the Admin App.

4. TODO List: The TODO List section is a highly beneficial feature of our app. Here, students can track their tasks, add new ones, mark tasks as completed, and delete them as needed.

All these features collectively make our app powerful and extremely convenient for both students and teachers.

Thank You!
